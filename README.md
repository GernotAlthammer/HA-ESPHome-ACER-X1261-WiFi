Alternatively to the ESP8266 WiFi-to-Serial interface it is also possible to use a USB-to-RS232 interface.

The control of the projector is then done via buttons that trigger shell commands.
The example for a setup of the USB configuration is in the folder <a href="https://github.com/GernotAlthammer/HA-ESPHome-ACER-X1261-WiFi/tree/main/HA-Panel" rel="nofollow">HA-Panel</a>.
